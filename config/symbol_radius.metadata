   Mantina et al. "Consistent van der Waals Radii for
   the Whole Main Group". J. Phys. Chem. A, 2009, 113 (19), pp
   5806–5812.

   Many of these elements, if they occur in a PDB file, should
   probably rather be skipped than used in a SASA calculation, and
   ionization will change the effective radius.
